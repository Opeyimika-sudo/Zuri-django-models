# Zuri-django-models

## Learnings
This project which is about building models helped me understand Django as an Object-Relational Mapper and how it relies heavily on databases to work.

One mistake I made was making migrations and realizing I made a mistake after so I had to delete the db.sqlite file because upon consulting the internet, I learnt that Django does not change existing database tables when you edit the models.
